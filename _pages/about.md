Hi! I'm a PhD student at UMass Amherst in Computer Science. I'm working under the supervision of [Hossein Pishro-Nik](https://infosec.cs.umass.edu/person/pishro-nik-hossein) and [Hedyeh Beyhaghi](https://hedyehbeyhaghi.github.io/).

My research focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) from both practical and theoretical perspectives. More specifically, I work on:

- **Test-time scaling** and **mixture of agents/experts**

Previously, I worked on explainability of Language Models and efficient fine-tuning.
